#Some setup, creating a list and dictionary to be
#used in some of the exercises:
import fibo
import demodict
fibolist = fibo.nacci(50)
demodict1 = demodict.generate_dict()
#####################################################

#####Lists!#####

#Just to get you going, here's the answer to
#the first exercise:
maybe_your_first_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Find the last element of fibolist:
fibolist_last = None

# Find the sum of all even entries (indices 0, 2, 4,...) of fibolist:
fibolist_even_entries_sum = None

# Lists can be extended. The next fibonacci number is 20365011074, add it to fibolist.

# Can you put a reversed copy of fibolist into fibolist_reversed without changing fibolist in place?
fibolist_reversed = None

A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
# Two lists can be concatenated with +. Concatenate A and B together, and store the result in A_and_B.
A_and_B = None

# Check if 1337 is in fibolist. If it is, make is_1337_fibo True, otherwise make it False.
is_1337_fibo = None

#####Tuples!#####

# Here's the first answer to the tuple section:
maybe_your_first_tuple = (0, 1, 2, 3, "hello", 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 4, 1, 1, 91)

# Tuples also support slicing like lists. Find the even- and odd-indexed entries of your tuple:
your_first_tuple_evens = None
your_first_tuple_odds = None

#####Sets!#####

#Again, the first exercise is done for you.
maybe_your_first_set = set([1,2,3,4,2])
#Note that len(maybe_your_first_set) = 4, whereas if it was a list its
#length would be 5. 

# Sets are often used to find the distinct elements of a list. Find the distinct elements below:
some_repeats = [1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,2345,345,2,52,243,5,2,345,523,45,5,4,2,2,3,5,234,2345]
distinct_elements = None

set_A = set(range(100))
set_B = set(range(0,200,2))

# Apply the union and intersection operations to set_A and set_B as indicated:
A_union_B = None
A_intersection_B = None

#####Dictionaries!#####

#Check out all the stuff you can put in dictionaries:
maybe_your_first_dict = {'key1':'val1', 'key2': 'val2', 
                         'key3': 0, 'key4': [1,2,3], (1,2):'tuples can be keys',
                         'but not lists': ["how", "sad", "for", "lists"]}


# Dictionary elements are accessed by key rather than position.
# Try it here - get the value of key "hello there" in the dictionary demodict1 (created at the top of this script):
hello_there_value = None

# remove the key "there" from demodict1:
